RESEARCH PHASE

## Project Overview

This project involves building a Brushless DC (BLDC) Motor Driver circuit (ESC) using 3-phase trapezoidal commutation. There are no load or torque requirements; the end goal is to simply make a motor spin and be able to programatically adjust its speed with a microcontroller.

The circuit needs to use mostly discrete components, aside from MOSFET driver ICs most likely. Also, I want to use an STM32 microcontroller and program the drivers myself (no Arduino).

## Educational Value Added

Building a (mostly) discrete BLDC motor driver is a complex project that gives experience with building high-current circuits, teaches some fundamental theory behind electronics used in robotics, and writing custom drivers for the microcontroller provides some experience with bare-metal programming.

## Tasks

This is my current plan, although it may change. I am admittedly stuck at the moment trying to understand how to approach this, so I will likely seek guidance.

[] Understand the theory behind trapezoidal control (almost there)
[] Determine some constraints
[] Determine which MOSFETS I will need based on the constraints and which motor I am using
[] Start designing
[] TBD...
